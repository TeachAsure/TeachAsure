TechAsure

TechAsure is a practical implementation of the research paper:
“A Deep Learning Framework for Speaker's Confidence Level Analysis”.

This project leverages the deep learning model proposed in the paper to analyze and evaluate a speaker's confidence level from speech or audio data. TechAsure processes audio input and provides numerical and visual feedback on the speaker's confidence, which can be used for applications like speech coaching, interview practice, or human-computer interaction systems.

The underlying model captures vocal features such as tone, pitch, and speech patterns, and predicts a confidence score that reflects how assured the speaker sounds. The code and pretrained models are available in this repository for easy experimentation and integration into other projects.
